// when pressed, window changes to a word with the letters hidden shown as _
// each letter should maybe be its own element to individually target them
// each element needs to contain the "hidden" version, and its own letter ("visible")
// when a key is pressed, if any of the blank (_) spaces contain that key, the _ is changed into the letter that was pressed
// when all of the letter elements have been made visible you win
// when you win, the win is logged into local storage and displayed in an alert

// a time interval must be added to the game
// when the time interval hits 0, the game ends and you lose
// when you lose, the loss is logged into local storage and displayed in an alert
